# Fund your Account

A minimum deposit of 5 AKT is required to deploy on Akash, and a small transaction fee is applied to deployment leases paid by the account used to deploy. There are two ways to get funds into your account, buy tokens, and join the Akash community to receive free tokens from the Akash Faucet.

* [Buy AKT from an exchange](../../../tokens-and-wallets/buy.md)
* [Join the Akash Community to get free AKT](../../../tokens-and-wallets/funding.md)
