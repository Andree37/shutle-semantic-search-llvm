# Troubleshooting

### Verify Certificates by Issuer

> _**NOTE**_ - following install this command will likely output No resources found which is expected and can be ignored. Revisit this command later and when certs have been generated by the issuer to view output.

```
kubectl get Issuers,ClusterIssuers,Certificates,CertificateRequests,Orders,Challenges -A
```
