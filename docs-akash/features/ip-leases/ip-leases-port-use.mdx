# IP Leases Port Use

The IPv4 standard defines ports 1-65535 as valid port numbers.&#x20;

You may use all the unique ports of a single leased IPv4 address amongst any combination of services.&#x20;

Attempting to use the `same port` on `two different` services with the same endpoint is an `error`.
